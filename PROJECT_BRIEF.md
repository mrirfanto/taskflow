# TaskFlow - Task Management Dashboard

## ðŸ§¾ Project Brief

> Hello! I'm the founder of a growing SaaS startup, and Iâ€™m looking to build a modern **Task Management Dashboard** called **TaskFlow**.  
> TaskFlow is a productivity tool designed to help teams manage tasks efficiently using a dashboard, kanban board, and calendar views.  
> Weâ€™ll be using **Supabase with PostgreSQL** as the backend platform â€” handling authentication, data storage, and real-time features. The frontend should be clean, responsive, and interactive, resembling high-quality SaaS products like Linear, Notion, or Trello.
> This project will be an excellent showcase of your ability to build full-stack, production-grade applications using modern tools and best practices.
